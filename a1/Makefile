# make is a program that reads a makefile such as this one to make it 
# easier to build programs.
#
# Since we haven't covered makefiles in class yet, this is a very simple
# Makefile.  You don't need to use it, but might find it helpful.
# You are welcome to add to it.  We will use our own Makefile to run tests.
